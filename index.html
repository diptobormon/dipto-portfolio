<p>After twenty years, you will be disappointed to think that you could not do what you could. So leave the safe haven. Travel for discovery, dream, and finally, discover!</p><p> "You cry at airports because you know the person you leave (including yourself) is never the same person who comes back. You do not goodbye a person. You goodbye a past that is not retrievable." </p>
<p>O crow,my only request is that you may eat the flesh of my body but do not eat my eyes,don't eat my eys as i wish to see my ma one last time!</p>

<h2>Full Stack Web Devoloper</h2>
<h3 class="orange">2022-Future | Pro Level Devoloper </h3>
<p>
    With the web development industry booming, many are asking the question: How do I become a web developer? I think that’s the wrong question to ask. It should rather be: How do I become a successful web developer?

This is important to ask, because so many people around the world are web developers, but how many of them are successful at it?

My goal for programming is to equip with the mindset, knowledge and skills to stand out from the crowd and make a success of web development career!

<p>If you want to do something great, it comes with compromise and sacrifice. If you want to be a successful web developer or freelancer and you’re complaining that you don’t have time, then just look at your daily/weekly/monthly routine to see what you can remove to free up more time so you can learn more, develop your skills and apply what you know.Motivation is always good, but it can be temporary. Discipline will get you to act when you’re not feeling like doing anything or when you aren’t excited to carry on.</p>
