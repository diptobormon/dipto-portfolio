<h2>Travelling, Exploring, Growing, Dreaming, Rising </h2>
<p>After twenty years, you will be disappointed to think that you could not do what you could. So leave the safe haven. Travel for discovery, dream, and finally, discover!</p><p> "You cry at airports because you know the person you leave (including yourself) is never the same person who comes back. You do not goodbye a person. You goodbye a past that is not retrievable." </p>
<p>O crow,my only request is that you may eat the flesh of my body but do not eat my eyes,don't eat my eys as i wish to see my ma one last time!</p>
